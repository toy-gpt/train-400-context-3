abstract: >
  Toy-GPT is an educational sequence of minimal language-model training repositories.
  This repository implements a next-token prediction model with a 3-token context window trained with
  softmax and cross-entropy loss. It serves as a baseline for understanding
  probabilistic language modeling, training loops, and inspectable model artifacts
  prior to introducing higher-order context, embeddings, or attention mechanisms.
